# Inspiration
The main inspiration for me to do this website was because of bad experiences when my teachers could not understand where me or my friends were coming from, whether it was related to mental health or other reasons. So, this is why I created this website so that teachers can understand what us, students, feel like and understand our emotions better so that in future sitations, the possibility of an problem occurring decreases.

# What it does
The website basically allows the teachers to enrol in courses and webinars that they would like to learn about, or even create their own courses and webinars if they are experienced in certain things. People can also share resources with one another, as a form of collaborating good resources. 

# How it's built
This was made with Flask, Python, HTML and CSS

# Challenges encountered
There were quite a few challenges that I encountered while I was creating this website. Firstly, I had way too many ideas that I wanted to put in-place into my website. However, the problem was that I had no idea how to so there were many things discombobulated in my mind that I had no idea how to implement. Moreover, since this website is for teachers, I was also thinking how to make this website more enticing for teachers, but it was a difficult task as we are both from different age groups. Lastly, I did not know how to upload documents in Flask before so I had to learn something new while making my website.

# Accomplishments
It's not a bad website but with more time and experience, I believe that I could give an even better final website.

# What I learned
I learnt more about how to create an uploading system, login system and etc.
